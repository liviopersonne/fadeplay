## Inspiration

https://github.com/KarimElghamry/chillify: Uses `flute_music_player`
https://github.com/iampawan/Flutter-Music-Player: Also uses `flute_music_player`

## Libraries

`just_audio`: Reading audio, seeking, fading, files etc...
`flutter_sound`: I don't use that but it gives more low level access, closer to BASS
`audio_session`: To handle system audio interruptions (like other media starting) on mobile
