## Libraries

`just_audio`: Reading audio, seeking, fading, files etc...

`audio_session`: To handle system audio interruptions (like other media starting) on mobile

### Interesting libraries

[`flutter_sound`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_sound): I don't use that but it gives more low level access, closer to BASS

[`musicbrainz_api_client`](https://pub.dev/packages/musicbrainz_api_client): Flutter client for musicbrainz

[`audio_metadata_reader`](https://pub.dev/packages/audio_metadata_reader): Read and write metadata in ID3 with few dependancies

[`audiotags`](https://pub.dev/packages/audiotags): Same but has rust dependancy that needs to be set up

[`metadata_god`](https://pub.dev/packages/metadata_god): Same but no support for ogg and wav

[`audio_video_progress_bar`](https://pub.dev/packages/audio_video_progress_bar): To see the progression of music
