## MUSIC PLAYER

Play music with a seekbar

Play music from specific subset (playlist / humeur etc...)

Global keyboard shortcuts

Store muic with: title (og & EN), artists (og & EN), album, cover, note, humeurs, instruments, language, source, date of creation, date of importation

Check out albums with one click (with downloaded and non downloaded music)

Check out other music by the same artist

## TRANSITIONS AND MIXES

Create music transitions with: track1, track2, startFadeOut, endFadeOut, startFadeIn, endFadeIn

The fadeIn values are a timestamp of track2

The fadeOut values are a timestamp of track1, counting in reverse from the end (-10.0 is 10 seconds before the end)

Have a cool visualizer for the transitions

Create mixes by selecting multiple transitions that flow into eachother, you can also directly select music and that will create a new transitions

Have an option to export these mixes

## MUSIC ANALYSIS

Automatically trim music with beginning and end of sound, with an option to modify that manually (be careful of existing transitions when doing that)

Normalize volume

Get the key of each music at all points of the music

Get the tempo of each music

Find automatic transition points

## IMPORT / EXPORT

Import music from musicbee db (with humeur / instruments etc...)

Export modifications to musicbee db

Import music infos from ytb music / musicbrainz / soundcloud / vgmdb

Import lyrics info from genius / others ??

Download music directly from ytb / ytb music / soundcloud / vgm site

Check out music mixes in ytb, download a section with a chapter or by using custom timestamps

## AUTODJ

When playing music, enable autodj to use automatic transition points and try yolo transitions, if you like what you just heard, you can then click on "save transition"

Perhaps I'll need to specify a minimum duration to avoid non-stop transitions

If connected to wifi, perhaps the autodj can try to play music I haven't downloaded from ytbmusic from an album in which I have already downloaded music in. If I like it I can "add to library"

## MOBILE

Firstly, just something that exports all music so that it can be played in an app on mobile

Then a full-on mobile music player with playlists
